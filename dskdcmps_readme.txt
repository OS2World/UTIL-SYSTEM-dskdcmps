dskdcmps

This file provides the capability to decompress
compressed dsk files. It is intended as a 
companion program to dskxtrct.

Compressed dsk files is one capability that
dskxtrct was never written to handle. While
very few IBM dsk files were distributed as 
compressed files, there has been at least one. 

Be aware that the compression used in dsk files is
the Lempel-Ziv-Welch, or LZW compression. In my 
research I found conflicting information about the
status of patents for this compression. And rather
than try to unravel this issue, and in order not
to produce a violating 'computer process' in the
form of a program, I am providing the enclosed
documented 'explanation' of how dsk files can
be uncompressed. The documentation happens to
be in a compilable form, but I am not suggesting
what you do with this, it is up to you to decide
how to used the enclosed 'explanation'.

Further, I take no responsibility or liability for
